#   Notice:
 I just test only in ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS<br>
 Cannot use in Windows <br>
 0 is charge and 1 is uncharge <br>

 Your command : python directory-of-chargeto.py your-percentage-here <br>
 Ex: python /home/son/chargeto.py 80<br>

 You can set alias for "python chargeto.py": <br>
 echo "alias short-name='python directory-of-chargeto.py'" >> ~/.bash <br>
 Then the command : short-name your-percentage-here <br>
